This is a discord bot I coded up earlier this summer. I'm really passionate about basketball statistics, mainly because my road to becoming an Analyst required me to pass some intense stat courses. Stats in the context of basketball helped me understand the courses a lot better, and now here I am honing a B.S. in Data Analytics. Anyway, I created a discord server where NBA researchers/bettors could come together and share their opinions and "tickets." I noticed that a large portion of their time was spent googling player stats. I wanted to change that. So I coded up Bball Stat Bot to fetch the stats for them.

Here's a list of the bot's functions with explanations:


!season_pts player_name - Fetches players average points for the season

!season_fg player_name - Fetches players average field goals for the season


!season_3p player_name - Fetches players average 3 points made for the season


!seaon_trb player_name - Fetches players average rebounds for the season


!season_ast player_name - Fetches players average assists for the season


!season_stl player_name - Fetches players average steals for the season


!season_blk player_name - Fetches players average blocks for the season


!season_tov player_name - Fetches players average turnovers for the season



!last_pts player_name days - Fetches players rolling average in points given n amount of days


!last_fg player_name days - Fetches players rolling average in field goals given n amount of days


!last_3p player_name days - Fetches players rolling average in 3 points made given n amount of days


!last_trb player_name days - Fetches players rolling average in rebounds given n amount of days


!last_ast player_name days - Fetches players rolling average in assists given n amount of days


!last_stl player_name days - Fetches players rolling average in steals given n amount of days


!last_blk player_name days - Fetches players rolling average in blocks given n amount of days


!last_tov player_name days - Fetches players rolling average in turnovers given n amount of days



!comparison player_name days - Fetches players average for the season in all stat categories, their rolling average given n amount of days in all stat categories, and renders a bar chart that compares them both respectively
